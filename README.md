# surfs_up

## Description of Project 

A group of investors wish to open a surf and ice cream shop on Ohau Hawaii. Provided with a multi-year file on weather data collected across 9 weather stations, we performed an analysis on the weather to assist the investors in making their decision. In addition, we created a FLASK app called "App" in order to share our initial findings with the investors via web links.
